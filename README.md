# Welcome to my Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my work as a developer, built using React to ensure high performance and fast development iterations. I’ve integrated Storybook and Styled Components to craft custom, reusable components that enhance the UI/UX.

To ensure quality and scalability, I’ve implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline powered by Docker, Jest, Storybook tests, and GitHub Actions. This setup ensures seamless deployment and continuous testing, allowing for a smoother development process.

Feel free to explore my projects, and if you’d like to discuss potential collaborations, don’t hesitate to reach out!
